            <h2>Rules and Reminders</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Upon submitting your gift, you will receive a confirmation email from our host. Please remember your gift number!</li>
                <li>Before the game begins, your name will be placed into a wheel that will
                    randomly draw each participant’s name to determine the order that gifts will be opened.</li>
                <li>During the game, you will see a grid of every gift hidden under a numbered gift box.</li>
                <p>To ensure that you do not choose your own gift, avoid choosing the gift number sent in your email.</p>
                <li>When the game begins, each participant will open gifts in the order they were chosen by asking the host to open a box of their choosing from the grid on the screen.</li>
                <li>Once the gift is revealed, the participant will be asked if they would like to keep their gift or “steal” it from another player.</li>
                <p>The person that goes first will be able to “steal” at the end of the game!</p>
                <li>Each participant gets one chance to open a gift and one chance to steal.</li>
            </ol>
